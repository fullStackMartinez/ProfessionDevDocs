			<h2>Last Week what I've done </h2>
			<p>A lot was done during the 10th week of the boot camp</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We finished our capstone and presented it to the community during Demo Day. This was a great experience, and got to meet a lot of people in the ABQ tech scene. I will be coming to all the Demo Days from now on for that reason.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Self Reflection</h2>
			<p>When I first thought about doing this bootcamp, I wasn't sure it would be the right thing. I grew up in the time where you had to have a degree to be taken seriously. I went ahead and got a 4 year degree, and even though it was a great experience, I don't even use it. That's why I was hesitant with this idea.</p>
			<p>After the 10 weeks, most of those hesitations have gone away. I feel a lot more confident in my skills, but am more confident that I can learn this stuff. It seemed to be that subject that only a certain genius could do. I now feel that it is the person willing to put in time and effort that succeeds in this field. I am happy to have done this, mainly because I feel that my skills are to a point that I can at least hang with a crowd of co workers who know more than me, and at least be able to understand them and learn from them.</p>
