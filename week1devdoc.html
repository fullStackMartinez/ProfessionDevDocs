			<h3>Goals I can measure| Week 1</h3>
			<h4>Toolset</h4>
			<p>With the boot camp starting this week, getting comfortable with my toolset is my main focus:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PHPStorm--Writing code every night in order to get used to the structure and how PHPStorm auto completes tags, how to <br>start and save projects to certain directories and link different pages(CSS)</li>
				<li>Git/GitHub--Getting comfortable with committing/pushing to GitHub, even with the smallest bits of code</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Professional Development Needs</h4>
			<p>Not only do I have hard skill goals, but also the <em>post</em> boot camp intentions.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>LinkedIn Profile--As part of my Professional Development, I'd like to set up my LinkedIn profile in order to start networking</li>
				<li>Resume building--I have a very weak resume at the moment. I'd like to build on that is not only complete but attractive .</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

			<h2>Golden Circle</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Why</em><br>The reason I want to attend and succeed in this boot camp is the change my future. After having worked<br>many different
				low paying jobs with no clear future or job security in site, I've decided to take 10 weeks of my life to secure fundamental skills
				that will gain me good employment and other professional opportunities.</li>
				<li><em>How</em><br>Study, practice and repetition. This is how I've been able to succeed and excel in all aspects of life. <br>I've
				played competitive sports, led student governments and advanced in any job I've ever had by learning and doing, taking a big problem and
				breaking it down, working from fundamentals to specialties.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<p>Since my congratulatory e-mail, I've been focusing my free time to learning the basics of HTML and CSS <br>and working my way throught the prework.
				Since we are only one day in, my reflections so far revolve around the environment I've come to find so far. <br>
				The "workplace" is comfortable, and I'm excited to be amongst other students striving to make a change in their <br>
				professional lives. I definitely feel part of a community.</p>
