			<h2>Goals I can measure| Week 1</h2>
			<h4>Toolset</h4>
			<p>With the boot camp starting this week, getting comfortable with my toolset is my main focus:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PHPStorm--Writing code every night in order to get used to the structure and how PHPStorm auto completes tags, how to <br>start and save projects to certain directories and link different pages(CSS)</li>
				<li>Git/GitHub--Getting comfortable with committing/pushing to GitHub, even with the smallest bits of code</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Professional Development Needs</h4>
			<p>Not only do I have hard skill goals, but also the <em>post</em> boot camp intentions.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>LinkedIn Profile--As part of my Professional Development, I'd like to set up my LinkedIn profile in order to start networking</li>
				<li>Resume building--I have a very weak resume at the moment. I'd like to build on that is not only complete but attractive .</li>
			</ul>

				<h2>Homework Activities</h2>
				<h3>My Learning Style</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Visual/Auditory (50%)</strong><br>I am definitely a very visual learner. Watching people/experts explain (YouTube tutorials, lectures with examples)</li>
					<li><strong>References/Textbook (20%)</strong><br>Having a textbook as a reference to go back to from a proven author is my second weapon in the arsenal.</li>
					<li><strong>Learn by Doing (30%)</strong><br>By getting my hands dirty I can make mistakes, learn from them, get comfortable with my work flow</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
			<h3>Qualitative Goals</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I want to be able to listen to my instructors and cohort, digest their advice and suggestions in order to fully grasp the fundamentals on data design.</li>
				<li>My study skills have to improve, and also the different studying routes available to me. This first week I've been discovering new avenues of help, and using them to my advantage. </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Quantitative Goals </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I want to increase my study time. We are currently in the Honeymoon Stage, and I would like to increase the time I spend outside of class solidifying what I learned that day.</li>
			</ul>
			</div>

			<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
				<img src="images/golden-circle.png.png" alt="A diagram of the Golden Circle">
			<p>The Golden Circle provides the opportunity to map out WHY you want to do something, HOW you plan on doing it, and WHAT that thing is.</p>
			<p>It is important to start from the middle and work your way out, making the WHY, your root to your goal, the most important part</p>
			<ul>
				<li>WHY: I want to be a part of a community of smart, motivated people that I can build useful and fun products in the sports world, while practicing my new skill. I love sports and would like to make a living working in that realm</li>
				<li>HOW: By building a good core of web development skills and marketing them into the sports community</li>
				<li>WHAT: Web development tools for Fantasy Football players</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<p>Since my congratulatory e-mail, I've been focusing my free time to learning the basics of HTML and CSS <br>and working my way throught the prework.
				Since we are only one day in, my reflections so far revolve around the environment I've come to find so far. <br>
				The "workplace" is comfortable, and I'm excited to be amongst other students striving to make a change in their <br>
				professional lives. I definitely feel part of a community.</p>

	<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
	<p>Hi my name is Esteban and I am a NM bred Full Stack Web Developer who is in love with sports. I've built up a strong set of
		coding skills so I can help sports teams communicate with their fans easily with a great website and even an app! I'm as
		competitive with my professional work as I was with my sports career, and really want to work with like minded people.
		Do you have any upcoming community or company events in the near future where I can network with sports minded people?</p>
