			<h2>Week 5 what I've done </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Week 5 was the first full week of Capstone group work. We got our first tickets and I got assigned the Organization Class. I completed my Class, and wrote my Unit Test</li>
				<li>Completed the Bootstrap 4 challenge. This was a tough one, Rochelle definitely challenged us, but I enjoyed it. It forced us to really dive into the documentation and outside resources in order to not only complete it, but also learn from it. Since we have so little time for the front end part of the bootcamp, it's really on us to push ourselves outside of class to develop those skills.</li>
				<li>Finished my resume and sent it in to Daniel</li>
				<li>We started our first steps into JavaScript, something I know I should try to get a firm grip on by the time I graduate from boot camp. This language is really powerful, and it is starting to pop up everywhere. Having worked so much on the back end and database design, I think I could be a strong junior developer with intermediate JavaScript skills. Outside of Capstone and PWP, JavaScript will be my main self teaching goal.</li>
				<li>Jolynn and I were responsible for reviewing our teammates code. I feel like her and I work well together, mainly because we trust each others skill and work ethic.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
			<p>Now that we are full steam ahead with our Capstone projects, I feel I really need to stay on top of my schedule and free time to complete the PWP, my individual responsibilities for Capstone and get ready for assessments. But I also know that my outside of class time should be used to build on the PHP and MySQL skills I've gained so far. With the rapid pace of the boot camp, I need to utilize that time better in order to feel confident enough to be productive in a job setting. I feel my strong points are my soft skills, I've always been comfortable around people, but I know that when it comes down to it I will need to show that I do know how to use these languages efficiently.</p>
			<p>By working hard in class with my group responsibilities, I hope to focus my evenings on studying the 3 main languages I came here to learn: PHP, SQL and JavaScript. In my opinion, these are the things that will get my foot in the door, whether it be with a company or building a freelance site for a friend. Using these last 5 weeks to cement those skills to an intermediate level are my ultimate goal.</p>

			<h2>Elevator Pitch number 2</h2>
			<p>Hi, my name is Esteban Martinez and I am currently for hire as a full stack web developer, specializing in PHP and MySQL databases. But I'd also like to briefly highlight some of my personality skills, such as working well with teams, being coachable and the ability to push myself. I like to think of myself as a ball of clay with web development skills, that you can mold into whatever fits your team best. Do you have any opportunities available at the moment?</p>
