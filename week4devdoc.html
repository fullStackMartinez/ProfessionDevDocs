			<h2>Homework Assignment</h2>
			<h3>Forbidden Island summary/ Team Capacity summary</h3>
			<p>As part of the weekly Development Doc, we were asked to write about our experience playing Forbidden Island, a group strategy game that really puts the
			emphasis on working as a team. We had just gotten into our groups, so it was a good way of finding out how each of us works and thinks. I found that we did pretty
			well going through the instructions, which was important and a little time consuming considering it was our first time playing. We did have some hiccups in team strategy
			though. When different personalities meet up to do an objective, you usually have the person that is just along for the ride, those that are trying to lead the
			team and those that facilitate the debates going on.</p>
			<p>I am definitely the kind of guy that plays wells with others, I've been doing it most of my life, and my tendency is to immediately take the leader role. I
			have learned certain skills and strategies that help me take on a leader role without explicitly saying &quot;I'm the leader&quot;. The first is to read the instructions, since
			 I know I can read at a good, understand pace while putting emphasis on important keywords. Reading the instructions also let's me be the one that understands the game more. You have to
			be able to put yourself in a expert in your field position so that others trust you. Of course, with that trust you have to be able to back it up. I usually study and practice
			hard enough to be able to back things I expect others to do up. I know that in order to be a strong team, we have to individually be strong.</p>
			<p>I found that I am good at asking specific questions that get good debate going. I don't want to be the leader, I want to be the guy who facilitates good argument
			so that we come to good conclusions together as a team. I also read people very quickly, and understand what they might be strongest at, and also their weak points. Already
			with Capstone I've found who will need to be pushed, who will need to push me, and who will need to be overseen. It's my nature, and it's a quality I take pride in because I want to win. Always.</p>
		<h3>Team lunch</h3>
			<p>As part of our homework, we were asked to plan a team lunch. We have decided that every Wednesday we would meet up for lunch, eat together and talk about something other than
			our project. It's important that we understand how we are personally in order to understand how we can push each other to do the best work for the team.</p>
			<h3>Finalize Resume</h3>
			<p>I am very happy with the end result of my resume. I updated my employment history to include Deep Dive as a job instead of education. This allows me to show
			that I have worked with development teams, and also showcase the Capstone project as physical evidence of my skill set. I also included a tech box per Daniel's advice. It's
			a simple list of languages I know and use that can be quickly recognized by employers. Finally, I decided to add a side note on personal decorations, mainly because it showcases
			the things that can't be taught or learned, for example working with teams (sports) and management (Student Government).</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<p>As always, I like to conclude the Dev Doc with my reflections on the week. First off, I have to buy Forbidden Island. My friends, with beers of course, would love this
			type of game, and it really did help as an ice breaker with our team. As a team we have to be able to know what our teammates boundries are, because there are many ways to say
			the same thing, and understanding who you are speaking to can determine how you tell that person to do something, or that they are wrong, or that they are right. Being able
			to say something negative in a respectful way gains respect, something we all need to have for each other. </p>
			<p>With Capstone officially beginning, I do like our project idea. I personally feel it is one of the more important project of the three since it is helping seniors in ABQ, and if
			successful could really look good on a resume. Hell, maybe the city decides to use it and really springboards our careers as junior developers. My team has good characters
			in it, but I do feel there are a couple of members that we will have to keep an eye out for, mainly because we are building something complicated that only 4 weeks ago we had
			no idea how to do. I like the challenge though, makes me motivated to really do something special that not only shows my technical side, but also that I know how to manage people.</p>
