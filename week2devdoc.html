			<h2>Goals I can measure| Week 2</h2>
			<h4>Entity Relationship Diagram</h4>
			<p>For the Data Design Project, I had to learn about how to plan a database. It started with learning about entities, what they are and what they contain. After naming entities, their attributes and their keys, it was important to figure out the relationships between entities. This was something new to me, and in order to due it properly I studied outside of class most nights, learning about ERD's and what they mean </p>
			<h4>MySQL Database</h4>
			<p>After understanding how to plan for a database, we learning and implemented a MySQL database. This included learning about what MySQL is and how to CREATE new tables, while INSERTING INTO those tables each attribute.</p>

				<h2>Homework Activities</h2>
				<h3>Send resume to Dan - Done</h3>
				<h3>Update LinkedIn</h3>
				<p>After signing up for LinkedIn, I added my Education, my Profile Picture and also aobut 7 skills. I also included my current employment status, Deep Dive Coding Intern</p>
				<h3>Google Search</h3>
				<p>Last week we learned the importance of online and professional identities. As part of our weekly homework, we were instructed to do a Google search on ourselves and write a quick reflection.<p>
				<p>My initial search was for &quot;Esteban Martinez Albuquerque&quot;. Immediately I realized that my name is pretty common in Albuquerque, and anywhere really. There are plenty of Esteban Martinez. This means I might have to do a little more work on making myself stand out from the crowd, mainly with professional avenues such as Github and LinkedIn.</p>
				<p>The first Google results bring up my Facebook account and then immediately my LinkedIn account. I think this is good because it puts me in the forefront with a generic search, giving me the opportunity to be seen first out of all the Esteban&quot;s out there. I believe with a personal professional website, I could be easily found.</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<p>After 2 full weeks of boot camp, I feel very comfortable with the cohort. My coworkers are just as hungry as me, and there is no competition when it comes to help. I use them as a resource and repay the favor by giving help. I have been using any and all free time outside of the class to deepen my understanding of the fundamentals of PHP and Object Oriented Programming. Link any skill, study and practice gives me confidence to use the new knowledge I&quot;ve gained. I undertand that there is still a lot of work and stress to be done, but by taking good notes and using free time to study what we learned that day, I feel confident in myself that I can keep up, and maybe even exceed the standard asked of me</p>

			<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
			<p>Hi my name is Esteban and I am a NM bred Full Stack Web Developer who is in love with sports. I've built up a strong set of
				coding skills so I can help sports teams communicate with their fans easily with a great website and even an app! I'm as
				competitive with my professional work as I was with my sports career, and really want to work with like minded people.
				Do you have any upcoming community or company events in the near future where I can network with sports minded people?</p>
