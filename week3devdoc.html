				<h2>Homework Activities</h2>
				<h3>WORTH QUESTIONS</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>What are internal and external factors keeping you from achieving your goal?</dt>
					<dd>When thinking about factors keeping me away from achieving my goals, there are a few that stick out like a sore thumb. Internally, especially so early into the boot camp, is the thought of not knowing enough to be productive in this field. Sometimes just thinking about getting a job and having to work with others who know so much more than me is intimidating, and makes me question if I will be ready or not. Externally, finances and time, or lack of finances and time, have always stood in the way of achieving. Usually, in order to get good at something, there is a fee, monetarily and in terms of time needed to work on your skill for free. I've always had a job to take care of myself, and not working in order to build skills that will make my future much brighter, is something new to me. I know that this is an investment in the long run, but it not having a steady income is a mental factor.</dd>
					<dt>How do you personally create value for others?</dt>
					<dd>My coaches over the years have always told me to leave it all on the field. It's something I've applied in all facets of my life, professionally and personally. By putting in the work on an individual level, preparing myself when nobody is looking, I give my teammates the opportunity to do the same. I expect to be ready for a challenge, and I expect it from those I work with too. My uncle always told me, if I want to be a successful person, I should surround myself with successful people, and by being that person, you will attract others with the same mentality. I like to help people, push them to become better at whatever it is they want to succeed in, because they will help the team win.</dd>
					<dt>Has anyone ever told you that you got potential professionally? Do you believe it? Why, Why not?</dt>
					<dd>The day I got an email saying I would be able to attend the boot camp with Access Funds, I told my boss and he immediately congratulated me. But he was also sad to see me go, because this is a man I've spent working under and with for many years. But he knew that I offered more to the world than meaningless labor work. He has always had the confidence in me to succeed, and that day he told me I had the potential to make a great life for myself by programming. I do believe him, because I've had plenty of jobs that I had never done before, and through my work ethic and the ability to learn fast, I've always excelled. Having seen me work through the years and also contribute mentally, he knew I'd be able to not just complete the program, but succeed afterwards</dd>
				</dl>
				<h3>Google Search</h3>
				<p>Last week we learned the importance of online and professional identities. As part of our weekly homework, we were instructed to do a Google search on ourselves and write a quick reflection.<p>
				<p>My initial search was for &quot;Esteban Martinez Albuquerque&quot;. Immediately I realized that my name is pretty common in Albuquerque, and anywhere really. There are plenty of Esteban Martinez. This means I might have to do a little more work on making myself stand out from the crowd, mainly with professional avenues such as Github and LinkedIn.</p>
				<p>The first Google results bring up my Facebook account and then immediately my LinkedIn account. I think this is good because it puts me in the forefront with a generic search, giving me the opportunity to be seen first out of all the Esteban&quot;s out there. I believe with a personal professional website, I could be easily found.</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<p>After 2 full weeks of boot camp, I feel very comfortable with the cohort. My coworkers are just as hungry as me, and there is no competition when it comes to help. I use them as a resource and repay the favor by giving help. I have been using any and all free time outside of the class to deepen my understanding of the fundamentals of PHP and Object Oriented Programming. Link any skill, study and practice gives me confidence to use the new knowledge I&quot;ve gained. I undertand that there is still a lot of work and stress to be done, but by taking good notes and using free time to study what we learned that day, I feel confident in myself that I can keep up, and maybe even exceed the standard asked of me</p>
