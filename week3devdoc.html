				<h2>Homework Activities</h2>
				<h3>WORTH QUESTIONS</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>What are internal and external factors keeping you from achieving your goal?</dt>
					<dd>When thinking about factors keeping me away from achieving my goals, there are a few that stick out like a sore thumb. Internally, especially so early into the boot camp, is the thought of not knowing enough to be productive in this field. Sometimes just thinking about getting a job and having to work with others who know so much more than me is intimidating, and makes me question if I will be ready or not. Externally, finances and time, or lack of finances and time, have always stood in the way of achieving. Usually, in order to get good at something, there is a fee, monetarily and in terms of time needed to work on your skill for free. I've always had a job to take care of myself, and not working in order to build skills that will make my future much brighter, is something new to me. I know that this is an investment in the long run, but it not having a steady income is a mental factor.</dd>
					<dt>How do you personally create value for others?</dt>
					<dd>My coaches over the years have always told me to leave it all on the field. It's something I've applied in all facets of my life, professionally and personally. By putting in the work on an individual level, preparing myself when nobody is looking, I give my teammates the opportunity to do the same. I expect to be ready for a challenge, and I expect it from those I work with too. My uncle always told me, if I want to be a successful person, I should surround myself with successful people, and by being that person, you will attract others with the same mentality. I like to help people, push them to become better at whatever it is they want to succeed in, because they will help the team win.</dd>
					<dt>Has anyone ever told you that you got potential professionally? Do you believe it? Why, Why not?</dt>
					<dd>The day I got an email saying I would be able to attend the boot camp with Access Funds, I told my boss and he immediately congratulated me. But he was also sad to see me go, because this is a man I've spent working under and with for many years. But he knew that I offered more to the world than meaningless labor work. He has always had the confidence in me to succeed, and that day he told me I had the potential to make a great life for myself by programming. I do believe him, because I've had plenty of jobs that I had never done before, and through my work ethic and the ability to learn fast, I've always excelled. Having seen me work through the years and also contribute mentally, he knew I'd be able to not just complete the program, but succeed afterwards</dd>

				<h3>DIRECT/INDIRECT INITIATIVES </h3>
				<P>DIRECT - This week I spoke to a friend that had been talking about a personal website for his cycling group. Before the boot camp he had offered to pay me to build him his site, and I never got back to him. I reached out and requested the work, he has yet to get back to me, but after the pro dev on Tuesday I figured it would be a good time to do this request.</P>
				<p>INDIRECT - After our guest speakers on Friday, I did some quick research into the different tech meet ups around the city in order to start building a network of professionals in this field. I don't know too many people who program in ABQ, so this would be a good way of getting to know people, letting them recognize me later in life, and hopefully become memorable enough to get work through them.</p>
				<h3>SALARY EXPECTATION</h3>
				<p>Before the boot camp, I would look at different resources such as Overstack Flow and Glassdoor to see what Web Developers were making and what to expect in the long run. I see this boot camp as an excellent investment into my future, so before taking the plunge I wanted to make sure it was a smart thing to do. The salary estimates were in the 80K range, which I thought was a bit high but also was excited to see. After looking through more local resources, I've come to expect that with no CS degree and very limited experience outside the boot camp, that my expected salary as an employ will be around the 45K range. This seems low, but in fact it is double what I had been making for the past 10 years of my life.</p>
				<p>After hearing John Mierzwa speak to us on Friday, I began to feel more hopeful about getting paid well with this new career path. It is important to understand that as the new kid, you have to be willing to put in the hard cheap work early on, because it is in experience that I will be getting paid in. After a couple of years experience, I will have hardened my skills and can began demanding more in pay and better jobs, since the opportunities will be more available to me.  </p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<p>The first 3 weeks of camp have been great, and even though we are moving at lightening speed, I have been able to utilize my time outside of class well. I have the support of staff, teammates, girlfriend and friends to be a hermit coding nerd, which gives me freedom to delve deeper into the resources available to me. I am done with the Data Design project, which at first seemed like hieroglyphics to me, especially the fundamentals such as grouping entities together. But through study and practice, those things don't seem as hard as they were. With anything I have ever done in my life, it seems hard until I finally jumped into it and spent efficient time learning it. Then by completing and comprehending these new challenges, my confidence grows, and it also lets me know that I will be able to do it. No matter the problem, I look back and realize that I have had challenges that I have overcome in the past, and it gives me that push I need to get things done.</p>
