			<h2>Week 7 what I've done </h2>
			<p>A lot was done during the 7th week of the boot camp</p>
			<ul>
				<li></li>
				<li>We had our first Assessment of the boot camp on Friday over Data Design and MySQL. I think as a group we underestimated how tough these assessments would be. I think I did ok with the open questions, but I'm not confident with my multiple choice answers. I will have to take more time during the week to prepare for the assessments. </li>
				<li>Started putting some work into my Personal Website Project. Monday we are supposed to have at least 50 percent of it done, and I think I have sufficient work to show, maybe even more than previously expected. My goal is to have a good product done early, which gives me time to maybe play around with some more advanced stuff we haven't really worked on yet.</li>
				<li>We had our War Games this week, studying and implementing security measures we learned the day before. I really enjoyed this, mainly because it was something different from our day to day work. It was frustrating but definitely opened my eyes up to the importance of security in web development.</li>
				<li>On Friday we had two speakers who really opened our eyes to the sales part of our careers. We learned of the importance of organization and following up with people that might have work. Also, following up with potential employment opportunities is something I'd like to work on more. We also had a chance to answer a question in front of everybody and receive feedback on how we were speaking publicly, another skill I feel I am strong at but can always use work with.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
			<p>Our Capstone project has really opened my eyes to the planning process of making an app, and how little I knew about how the web worked. I have been doing extra studying on HTTP and security, another aspect of web development whose understanding went under the radar for me.</p>
			<p>With 4 weeks left in the boot camp, my mind is going in two different directions. The first is using every minute of the next month to build my individual skills in order to get a job quickly after boot camp. This is me thinking ahead to what I, Esteban, need to do for my future. The other side of the coin is being a good teammate and making every effort to make sure the Capstone project works and looks great. This includes making time to review and help my teammates who might not be understanding certain concepts as much as myself. I fully plan to do both, the team and the individual stuff in order to give myself the best chance of success.</p>
